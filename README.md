# EC2 Instance Launch with Enforced Tagging Policy Using IAM (Without AWS Organizations)

## üìå Project Description

This project demonstrates how to enforce mandatory tagging when launching EC2 instances using only AWS IAM policies ‚Äî without relying on AWS Organizations or Service Control Policies (SCPs). It ensures that instances cannot be launched unless the following tags are provided:

- `Name`
- `emailID`
- `phoneNo`
- `Place`

This approach supports better cost tracking, resource management, and operational governance.

## üéØ Objective

The objective of this project is to enforce mandatory tagging during EC2 instance creation without using AWS Organizations. By applying a custom IAM policy, EC2 launches are denied unless the required tags are provided. The project demonstrates both successful and failed launch scenarios, using only identity-based policies within a single AWS account.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create IAM Policy

Create a custom IAM policy with the following JSON to deny EC2 launches if required tags are missing:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyRunInstanceWithoutTags",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "Null": {
          "aws:RequestTag/Name": "true",
          "aws:RequestTag/emailID": "true",
          "aws:RequestTag/phoneNo": "true",
          "aws:RequestTag/Place": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

Step 2: Attach Policies to IAM User
Attach:

‚úÖ AmazonEC2FullAccess

‚úÖ The above custom policy

Step 3: Launch EC2 Instance With Tags (Success Case)
During instance creation, add all required tags

Step 4: Launch EC2 Without Tags (Failure Case)
Skip the tagging step or remove one tag.


‚úÖ Conclusion
This project implemented tag enforcement for EC2 instances using IAM policies, ensuring no instances are launched without required metadata. It provides a lightweight alternative to AWS Organizations for individual users or small teams and promotes disciplined cloud resource management.
